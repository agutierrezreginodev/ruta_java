# Java Learning Repository

This repository contains educational projects developed during my Java programming learning process, focusing on fundamental concepts and best practices in software development.

## Objective

To document and share my progress in learning Java by implementing practical projects that demonstrate the application of object-oriented programming concepts, data structures, and application development.

## Projects

### MiniStore and MiniStore V2.0
Inventory management system that implements a mini-store with full CRUD, purchasing, and reporting functionalities.

**Features:**
- Product inventory management
- Purchasing system with stock validation
- Ticket and report generation
- Advanced searches
- Graphical interface with JOptionPane

[See complete project documentation](./MiniStore/README.md)

## Technologies and Concepts Implemented

### Languages
- Java (JDK 13+)

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation (private attributes, getters/setters)
- Inheritance (extends)
- Polymorphism (method overriding)
- Abstraction (abstract classes and methods)

### Data Structures
- ArrayList (dynamic lists)
- HashMap (key-value maps)
- Arrays (static arrays)
- Synchronization between structures

### Exception Handling
- try-catch-finally
- NumberFormatException
- IllegalArgumentException
- Custom validations

### Graphical Interfaces
- JOptionPane (javax.swing)
- showInputDialog
- showMessageDialog
- Interactive menus

### Best Practices
- Multi-layer data validation
- Separation of responsibilities
- Clean and readable code
- Robust error handling
- Data normalization for searches
- Documentation with comments
- Descriptive variable and method names

### Programming Concepts
- Variables and primitive data types
- Logical and comparison operators
- Control structures (if, switch, while, for)
- String comparison (.equals() vs ==)
- StringBuilder for efficient concatenation
- Static variables for shared values
- Public and private methods
- Constructors and overloading

### String Manipulation
- toLowerCase() / toUpperCase()
- trim()
- isEmpty()
- contains()
- equals() / equalsIgnoreCase()
- Text normalization

### Data Structures Management
- for-each iterations
- CRUD operations with collections
- Filters and searches
- Duplicate validation

## Skills Developed

- Analysis and design of object-oriented systems
- Implementation of inheritance relationships
- Memory and reference management
- User data validation and sanitization
- Application state and flow management
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Reading and understanding technical documentation
- Application of basic design patterns

## Next Steps

- Implement data persistence (files/database)
- Develop complete graphical interfaces with Swing/JavaFX
- Explore design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer)
- Implement unit testing (JUnit)
- Learn about advanced collections (TreeMap, LinkedList, etc.)
- Study functional programming in Java (Streams, Lambdas)
- Implement REST APIs with Spring Boot

## Learning Resources

- Official Java documentation
- Practical OOP tutorials
- Data structure exercises
- Clean code best practices

## Contact and Collaboration

This is a public learning repository. Any suggestions, corrections, or constructive comments are welcome to improve my learning process.

## Notes

This repository is constantly updated with new projects and improvements to existing ones as I progress in my training as a Java developer.
